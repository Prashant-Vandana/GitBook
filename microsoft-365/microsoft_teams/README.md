# Nightfall for Microsoft Teams

Nightfall for Microsoft Teams prevents sensitive content that is shared through Microsoft Teams. Sensitive information and specific types of data like social security numbers, credit card numbers, or passwords are scanned and prevented from unintentional leakage.

Nightfall for Microsoft Teams scans all messages and documents that are exchanged over Channels (Private, Public, and Shared) and prevents sensitive information (such as credit card numbers or health records) from being leaked. Scans will include archived items, but not deleted items.
