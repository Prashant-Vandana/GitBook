# Configure Detection Rules in Microsoft Teams DLP

In this section, you can select the Detection rules for the policy and If not already created, you can create detection rules.

* **Selected Detection Rules**: View detection rules that are selected and mapped to this policy
* **Unselected Detection Rules**: View detection rules that are neither selected nor mapped to this policy.&#x20;
