# Configure Detection Rules for OneDrive

In this section, you can select the Detection rules for the policy and If not already created, you can create detection rules. To learn more about how to configure detection rules, see [Configuring Detection Rules](https://help.nightfall.ai/nightfall-ai/nightfall-for-slack/installation-instructions-nightfall-for-slack-1/configuring-detection-rules).

You can use the search bar to search for a detection rule by its name.&#x20;

Once the required detection rules are displayed, you can select the required detection rules by ticking the respective check box. When you select any detection rule, you can view three options.&#x20;

These three options are related to the display of detection rules.&#x20;

* **All Detection Rules**: This option displays all the available detection rules, irrespective of the detection rule(s) selected.
* **Selected Detection Rules**: This option displays only those detection rules that you have selected.
* **Unselected Detection Rules**: This option displays only those detection rules that you have not selected.

Select the check box(es) of all the detection rules you wish to include in the policy. The policy evaluates only those detection rules that you have selected here. Once you select all the required detection rules, click **Next** to move to the next stage.&#x20;
