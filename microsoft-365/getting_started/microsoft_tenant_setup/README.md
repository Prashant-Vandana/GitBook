3. Enter the email address and password to sign in to Microsoft 365 administrator login. You may be prompted to perform multi-factor authentication on the Microsoft Authenticator app, if you have setup multi-factor authentication.
4. Upon successful authentication, you can view the following list of permissions that are required by the Nightfall Azure app:
   * Permission to read the organization's details
   * Permission to manage the Azure app permissions and grants for individual services like Microsoft Teams.
   * Permission to read and update Azure applications for individual services like Microsoft Teams
   * Permission to read and update the user profile
5. Click **Accept** and your Microsoft 365 tenant information is added to Nightfall.
6. Select the Microsoft applications you want to monitor. Currently, **OneDrive for Business** and **MS Teams** are the available applications.
7. Click **Save Changes.**                 &#x20;
8. Click **Finish** to complete the tenant setup.

You can see that the new MS Teams and OneDrive tenants are now onboarded in Nightfall under the Microsoft 365 integration. You can expand to view the details and collapse to hide the details.&#x20;

After a successful Directory Sync and M365 tenant registration, you can see that the apps selected in step 6 (MS Teams, OneDrive) show a **Valid** status, which implies they are ready to be monitored for sensitive data. You may proceed with the policy creation for either MS Teams, or OneDrive.

If you have not enabled either the OneDrive or the Teams application in step 6, the **Connect** button is displayed against the app. You can click the **Update App Selection** button to enable to the app.&#x20;

## Deleting a Tenant

You can delete a Microsoft tenant. Before you can delete a tenant, you must ensure that there are no active policies configured for that tenant. After you delete a tenant, you would not create any policies on the deleted tenant and Nightfall would not monitor the deleted tenant.&#x20;

To delete a tenant:

1. Click the delete icon for the required tenant. A delete confirmation window is displayed
2. Click **Yes, please.**&#x20;
3. Click **Connect**.&#x20;
4. Log in to Microsoft 365 by entering your admin credentials.&#x20;
5. The Microsoft sign-in window pop-up is displayed. Select the required option.&#x20;
6. The Nightfall delete confirmation window is displayed. Click **Yes, please delete**.&#x20;
7. The delete confirmation window is displayed. Click **Finish**.
