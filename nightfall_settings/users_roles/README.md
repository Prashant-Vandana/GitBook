The invited user receives an invite email. They must click the link and set a password to activate their account. &#x20;

Users who successfully activate their account are displayed as active users and their status is displayed as **Active** under the Status column. A user who does not accept the invite is displayed as **Expired** under the Status column.&#x20;

Admins can resend the invite email to Expired users by clicking the ellipsis menu.&#x20;

As you can see in the above image, Admins can also edit or delete users from the Nightfall app from the ellipsis menu.&#x20;
