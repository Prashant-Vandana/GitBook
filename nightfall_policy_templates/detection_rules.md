# Detection Rules

To view the recommended configurations to apply to different use cases, you are welcome to leverage the [**Detection Wizard**](https://playground.nightfall.ai/detection-wizard) in the Nightfall Playground. This wizard will generate the detection rules that you can apply in your Nightfall console. Learn more about [**Creating Detection Rules**](../detection_platform/create_detection_rules.md).

Once you have generated the detection rules, you can implement these templates on your own and add the detection rules to your [**Nightfall Dashboard**](https://app.nightfall.ai/detection-engine/detection-rules). You should be all set within 10-15 minutes.

Alternatively, feel free to forward the email you receive with the templates to support@nightfall.ai to have your Customer Success Manager implement these in your tenant on your behalf.

Once you've implemented your detection rules, test them using our [**sample data sets**](https://help.nightfall.ai/nightfall-detection-and-policy-templates/nightfall-test-data-sets).
