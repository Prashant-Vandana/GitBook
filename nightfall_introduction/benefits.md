# Benefits of Nightfall

Nightfall has several key benefits, including:

* Reductions in both the cost and occurrence of data breaches. Nightfall limits the exposure of things like credentials and secrets, which are a common cause of data breaches. Nightfall also limits the exposure of PII and other business critical content, which means that if a breach does occur, its impact is minimized
* Nightfall generates time savings by helping automate the task of discovering, classifying, and appropriately remediating sensitive and business-critical data.
