# Cloud-native DLP vs. CASB

A common misconception is that Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs) can accomplish the same level of DLP protection as cloud-native DLP solutions. CASBs are deployed as proxies and sit between the network layer and the cloud application layer allowing them to inspect traffic traveling between your network and designated cloud environments. The limitations of CASBs stem primarily from the fact that they can only inspect network traffic, and do not natively integrate with cloud applications or infrastructure.

A summary of differences between Nightfallâ€™s Cloud DLP and CASBs is shown below.
