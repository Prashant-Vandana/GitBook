File Fingerprint Detector - creates a unique hash of the sensitive files that enables you to receive alerts and discover where they are located or shared. </p><p>   . File Type - Receive alerts when certain file types (like audio or video) are discovered. You can adhere to compliance policies that prohibit certain file types from being shared on particular applications or storage locations. These file types are detected regardless of file extension. </p><p>File Name - You can scan for sensitive data in file names a well as file content by setting the “scope” of detection on your Detectors. Use regular expressions to match either file extensions or file names.</p></li><li>A new remediation option is available for violations detected in Google Drive. From the violations console, administrator can disable download of offending files. Click More Options ellipsis (...) next to a violation finding to access the option.</li><li>You can now provide custom HTTP headers to alerts sent to webhooks. These headers may be used to support systems collecting SIEM data that do not allow for query string authentication as well as other purposes such as routing.</li><li><p>Enhancements for a simplified, efficient violation monitoring workflow: </p><p>    . Finding type to be the first column as a stronger risk assessment vector. </p><p>    . Age of violation is the primary way date and time are factored into risk assessment.</p><p>    . Violation status is instantly visible/available with color-coded status pills.</p><p>    . Improved UI reducing the amount of content displayed by removing policies, and integration columns.</p></li><li>Historical scans in Google Drive and Confluence are now disabled by default for all new Nightfall customers. You can reach out to Nightfall support to request historical scans in Google drive or Confluence.  Existing customers shall continue to view historical scans from the console.</li><li>Nightfall administrators can instantly select specific users of apps whose messages must be excluded from scans. This feature is supported on both Slack Pro &#x26; Enterprise.</li></ol> |
| October 2022  | Enhancement: Webhook alerts - Updated schema v2                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | <p>Updated schema for webhook alerts enables you to: </p><p>  1. Filter and report per tenant with a company UUID key/value pair in each alert. </p><p>  2. Consolidate common fields into one, coherent core set that is shared across all integrations for consistent, out-of-the-box reporting and analytics across all integrations.</p><p>  3. List all findings up to 1000 per alert removing aggregation/summary for detailed downstream reporting an analytics. </p><p>  4. Remove findings results from JSON key names eliminating custom scripting required to extract and analyze findings. </p><p>  5. Keep Integration specific information under integration metadata.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
