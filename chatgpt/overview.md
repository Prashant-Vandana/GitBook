# Overview

Nightfall DLP plugin for Google Chrome can ensure security and compliance when using ChatGPT.

You can:

* Configure policies with granular detection rules, detector tuning, and custom detectors
* Create and enforce tenant-specific policies using pre-built detectors
* Enable the safe use of ChatGPT instead of blocking employee productivity&#x20;

The plug in can detect over 100 sensitive data types using Nightfall’s industry-leading ML-trained detectors. It automatically detects PII, PCI, PHI, secrets, and credentials including API keys and certificates, and keeps your data compliant with industry frameworks like ISO-27001, SOC 2, and HIPAA.

The plugin also redacts sensitive data before it’s proliferated into LLMs like OpenAI by intercepting sensitive PII, PCI, PHI before the information is submitted through real-time, end-user remediation.

You can monitor violations from the Nightfall console, receive automated alerts to Slack, email or SIEM of choice, and receive context-rich alerts and remediate violations in real time.
