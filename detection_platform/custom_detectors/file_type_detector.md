# Create File Type Detector

A File Type detector allows you to select MIME (multi-purpose mail extension) types. The selected MIME types are considered as tokens and Nightfall scans your data to identify if there is anything that matches the MIME token. If a match is found, it is flagged as sensitive data.&#x20;

To create a File Type Detector:

1. Navigate to the Detectors section from the left pane.
2. Click **+ Custom Detector** and select **File Type**.&#x20;
3. Enter a name for your custom Detector in the Name field.&#x20;
4. (Optional) Enter a description for the Detector in the Description field.
5. Click **Add File Type** and select an MIME type.&#x20;
6. (Optional) Repeat step 3 to add multiple MIME types to your rule.&#x20;
7. (Optional) Click the delete icon to delete an MIME type, if you do not require it.&#x20;
8. Click **Add**.
