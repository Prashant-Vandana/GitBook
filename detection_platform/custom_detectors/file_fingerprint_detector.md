# Create File Fingerprint Detector

A File Fingerprint detector allows you to upload a file. You must enter the exact data that is sensitive to your organization, in this file. Nightfall scans your data to check if there is an exact match between the contents of the uploaded file and your organization's data. If a match is found, it is flagged as sensitive data.&#x20;

To create a File Fingerprint Detector:

1. Navigate to the Detectors section from the left pane.
2. Click **+ Custom Detector** and select **File Fingerprint**.&#x20;
3. Enter a name for your custom Detector in the Name field.&#x20;
4. (Optional) Enter a description for the Detector in the Description field.
5. Upload or drag and drop the text file whose content needs to be matched.&#x20;
6. Click **Add.**
