# Nightfall Alert Platforms

Nightfall alert platforms support the configuration of various SaaS apps as alert destinations. Once you configure a SaaS app as an alert destination, you can use it in policy configuration. Nightfall provides you with three SaaS apps that you can use as alert destinations. Apart from these three alert destinations, you can use Email and Webhooks as alert destinations too.&#x20;

To access the Alert Platform:
