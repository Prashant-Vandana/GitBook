# Deduplication and Automatic Resolution of Events

Deduplication reduces the number of distinct Events created for a finding that is already accounted for by an active Event. Deduplication prevents the creation of redundant Events which are related to an already existing Event.&#x20;

When sensitive data is deleted from its location, Nightfall automatically changes the status of the related Event to Resolved. However, this process is not implemented in every scenario.

The following tables explains the various scenarios and how Deduplication and Auto resolve work in those scenarios, for each integration.

## Google Drive

### Deduplication

### Auto Resolve

| User Action in Google Drive                                                                                |                                                                                           |                                          |

| The user deletes the document containing sensitive data without removing the sensitive data present in it. | The user deletes the document called Data without erasing the credit card number from it. | The Event is not resolved automatically. |

## Confluence
