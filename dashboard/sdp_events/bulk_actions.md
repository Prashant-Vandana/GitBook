# Applying Bulk Actions on Events

Nightfall allows you to perform actions on a large set of Events. The Violations page displays a maximum of 50 Events. With Bulk actions, you can choose to implement an action either on the 50 Events which are currently displayed on the screen or on all the Events including the 50 displayed on the Events page.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Important**

* You can apply bulk action on a set of Events, only if all the violations belong to a specific integration. Hence, you must use the filter on the integration screen to view only those violations which belong to a specific integration.&#x20;
* You cannot apply remediation actions on expired Events. Events expire automatically after 30 days.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

For example, you can apply filter to display on Events reported by the Salesforce integration. Once you apply the filter to view only Salesforce integrations, you can then apply bulk action on all the Salesforce Events.&#x20;

To use the Bulk actions feature:

1. Navigate to the Sensitive data Events page in Nightfall.
2. Apply an integration filter to view the list of Events which belong to a specific integration. You must select only a single integration. If you select multiple integrations, you cannot use the Bulk actions feature.&#x20;
3. Select the **Finding** check box. The 50 violations displayed on the screen are selected.&#x20;
