# Does Nightfall require data to be already tagged?

No, Nightfall doesn’t require data to be pre-tagged. Nightfall uses machine learning to detect 100+ types of sensitive data out of the box, without prior tuning or tagging required. This includes forms of PII, PHI, PCI, and other sensitive content – for example, emails, social security numbers, etc. Our detectors leverage context surrounding a specific token to properly identify and classify it, which dramatically improves accuracy over traditional rules-based approaches to DLP.
