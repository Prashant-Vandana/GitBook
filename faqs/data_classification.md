# How does Nightfall classify data?

Nightfall uses machine learning to classify data. Our deep learning-based classifiers are trained on massive volumes of data to yield high accuracy. Unlike traditional methods, Nightfall considers the context surrounding a given token in order to accurately classify it. This means Nightfall performs well on unstructured and ambiguous data, which is increasingly common in enterprises today. Nightfall parses and scans 100+ file types, including images, screenshots, compressed folders, PDFs, etc. Our classifications are fed into the Nightfall platform so you can review & remediate the findings, or leverage them in your own way via our Firewall for AI.
