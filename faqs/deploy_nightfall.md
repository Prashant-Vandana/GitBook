# How do I deploy Nightfall?

Nightfall integrates with a variety of cloud services. Because Nightfall is the industry’s first cloud-native DLP solution, it’s simple and seamless to deploy, with no agent installation required or any endpoint/network changes.

Nightfall typically integrates as a third-party app into SaaS applications like Slack via OAuth 2.0. For example, imagine you were logging into Spotify or OpenTable via your Facebook account. This same authentication protocol is what Nightfall uses to integrate into apps like Slack or GitHub. This means that integrating a service like Slack with Nightfall takes just a few clicks by an administrator.

Nightfall is an approved app in SaaS vendors’ “marketplace” ecosystems, for example the Slack Marketplace and GitHub Marketplace. Get up and running quickly with our easy to navigate dashboards and comprehensive documentation.
