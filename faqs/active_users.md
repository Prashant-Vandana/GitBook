<table><thead><tr><th width="191">Integration</th><th>User Count</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gmail</td><td>You can view the list of users using the Gmail integration by navigating to the <code>Reporting > User Reports > Apps usage</code> page from the Google Workspace admin console. You can refer this <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/11479894?hl=en&#x26;sjid=13943315555498192084-AP">Google documentation</a> for more help.</td></tr><tr><td>Zendesk</td><td>You can view the list of users using the Zendesk integration by navigating to the <code>Admin Center > People > Team > Team members</code> page.

You can navigate to the <code>Settings > Directory Sync</code> page. This page also displays the total number of guest users (if any) invited to your Azure ID active directory (AD). So the total Active user count is the sum of total licensed Azure Entra ID Active Directory users and guest users invited to your Entra ID AD.</td></tr><tr><td>Notion</td><td>You can view the list of users using the Notion integration by navigating to the <code>Settings &#x26; members > Analytics > Members tab</code>.

That removes users who are no longer able to use Google Workspace and any group aliases (e.g. if you have a Sales team alias under sales@companydomain.com, it is not included in the Active user count).</p></td></tr><tr><td>Salesforce</td><td>Salesforce offers various user licenses but Nightfall only relies on the count of standard user licenses, if and when applicable.
