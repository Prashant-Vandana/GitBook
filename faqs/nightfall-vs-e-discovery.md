# Nightfall vs E-Discovery: What's the difference?

E-discovery and data loss prevention (DLP) are different, albeit conceptually similar. Nightfall is a cloud-native DLP platform.

E-discovery typically pulls messages and files from a platform to store the information in third-party data warehouses, where messages and files can be searched, archived, or retrieved. This serves legal and compliance use cases should the data need to be retrieved or searched for a legal hold.

DLP ensures sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information (PII), isnâ€™t shared inappropriately by scanning for content within messages and files that break selected policies. This serves security and compliance use cases around discovering, classifying, and protecting sensitive data.
