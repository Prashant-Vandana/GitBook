# How can I estimate the data volume that Nightfall needs to scan?

Estimating the amount of data that Nightfall will scan in your organization is an essential step in planning for the usage of historical scans.&#x20;

The data requirements vary based on the integration. Refer to the respective integration below to understand the potential data volume required to scan via historical scans:

<table><thead><tr><th width="191">Integration</th><th>Reference</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Slack</td><td><p>The total amount of data usage is not readily available in the Slack console. Nightfall recommends you <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/201658943-Export-your-workspace-data">export your Slack workspace data</a> for historical scans on Slack. The exported archive file contains messages and links to files shared in Slack. Hence, the size of the exported archive file will likely be very small compared to the total amount of data to be scanned via Nightfall. </p><p></p><p>Nightfall recommends you export workspace data for up to the last three months, as an example, and request the Nightfall team to run a historical scan on this exported data. Once the historical scan is complete, Nightfall can help you identify the total data scanned (GB) for the respective time period. You can use this information to understand the average monthly data volume in your Slack environment to extrapolate the total data volume required to scan data over a larger time period.    </p><p></p><p>For a basic understanding on usage limits in Slack, refer  <a href="https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/115002422943-Usage-limits-for-free-workspaces">https://slack.com/intl/en-in/help/articles/115002422943-Usage-limits-for-free-workspaces</a></p></td></tr><tr><td>Google Drive</td><td><p>Google workspace administration console provides visibility of the storage usage on Google drive. You can use this information to estimate the total data volume required for historical scans on Google drive. </p><p></p><p>Refer to the Google workspace documentation for details on where to find the storage usage on Google drive <a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/12002268?hl=en&#x26;ref_topic=13135206&#x26;sjid=7783233059016813973-AP">https://support.google.com/a/answer/12002268?hl=en&#x26;ref_topic=13135206&#x26;sjid=7783233059016813973-AP</a></p></td></tr><tr><td>Salesforce</td><td><p>Salesforce console provides visibility of the storage usage that can be used to estimate the total data volume required for historical scans on Salesforce. </p><p> </p><p>Refer to the Salesforce documentation for details on where to find the storage consumption in Salesforce:</p><p><a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.admin_monitorresources.htm&#x26;type=5">https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.admin_monitorresources.htm&#x26;type=5</a></p></td></tr><tr><td>Jira/ Confluence</td><td><p>Atlassian admin console may not provide clear visibility of the storage consumption on Jira and Confluence.  Hence, Nightfall recommends a sample historical scan for a limited time period, last three months as an example, to be executed to estimate the total data volume required for historical scans on Jira and Confluence. </p><p></p><p>Refer to the Jira and Confluence documentation for a basic overview on where to find the storage consumption: <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/track-storage-and-move-data-across-products/">https://support.atlassian.com/security-and-access-policies/docs/track-storage-and-move-data-across-products/</a></p></td></tr><tr><td>GitHub</td><td><p>You can get visibility of the total storage consumption in GitHub to understand the total data volume required for historical scans on GitHub. </p><p></p><p>Refer to the GitHub documentation for details on where to find the storage usage: <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage">https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-storage-and-bandwidth-usage</a></p></td></tr><tr><td>Zendesk</td><td>Refer to Zendesk documentation for details on where to find storage usage: <a href="https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408823446938-Managing-your-account">https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408823446938-Managing-your-account</a></td></tr></tbody></table>
