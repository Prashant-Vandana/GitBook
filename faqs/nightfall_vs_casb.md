# Nightfall vs CASB: What's the difference?

Nightfall is the industry’s first cloud-native data loss prevention platform that discovers, classifies, and protects data via machine learning. In contrast, a CASB (cloud access security broker) is typically a network-based solution that sits between cloud service users and cloud applications to monitor activity and enforce security policies. Data loss prevention identifies and protects sensitive content from loss, such as inappropriate use, sharing, exfiltration, or misuse.

CASBs may have limited data classification and protection capabilities via API, although they aren’t designed for this purpose. As with any monolithic vendor that tackles a wide breadth of problems, a CASB doesn’t achieve the same level of depth in functionality, accuracy in detection, or granularity in remediation as a best-of-breed DLP solution.

Nightfall is designed to inspect content, so we cover a much broader set of (over 100+) file types, including unstructured data, and detect a broader set of (over 100+) detectors. Likewise, accuracy is substantially improved via machine learning. In summary, Nightfall may work well with a CASB if you already have one, or as a replacement for companies focused on high-fidelity data protection in the cloud.
