# In the Atlassian Marketplace, why does it show that the Nightfall app is not approved in security?

Nightfallâ€™s apps are not part of the Cloud Fortified Apps Program with the main reason being support for the bug bounty program. However, we are in compliance with Atlassian security requirements and apps are regularly updated to any recommendations from Atlassian. To learn more about Atlassian security requirements, refer to [this document](https://developer.atlassian.com/platform/marketplace/security-requirements/).
