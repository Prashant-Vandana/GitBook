# Can I Disable Detection in Private Channels or DMs?

If you are a Nightfall Enterprise for Slack customer, Nightfall can automatically scan your entire Slack organization - including all public channels, private channels, and direct messages (DMs) in your workspace. You can make these selections in your policy configuration.&#x20;

If you are a Slack Pro customer, Nightfall is not able to scan within private channels or DMs unless the Nightfall Pro bot is invited into those channels.

On Nightfall Enterprise for Slack, you may wish to exclude detection and monitoring for specific channels and conversations

With the new features in the Slack Enterprise offering, you can now do this easily.

Upon Slack Policy creation, select which Slack channels or conversations you would like to **Exclude** from monitoring:

* Within your Slack policy, enter the conversation ID of the channels or conversation you would like to exclude
* To find a channel's conversation ID, right click the channel in Slack and copy link. The Conversation ID is at the end of the link, after the last forward slash.
