# I am unable to view a sensitive message or file from the Nightfall alert channel.

If you are a Nightfall Enterprise for Slack customer, you will receive alerts on sensitive data found in public channels, private channels, and direct messages. If you are a Nightfall Pro customer, you will receive alerts on sensitive data found in parts of the workspace that the Nightfall bot is a member of, typically public channels and perhaps select private ones.

If the sensitive content is in a public channel, the link in the Nightfall alert channel (#nightfall-alerts-slack by default) will take you to that content in Slack. If the content is in a private channel or DM, and you are not a member of that private channel or DM, you will be unable to directly view the sensitive message from the link in the Nightfall alert channel because your Slack permissions do not allow you to view this content. Attempting to follow the alert channel’s “Go to message” link may redirect you to a page like the one below:

**To view this content on Nightfall Enterprise for Slack,** we suggest quarantining it. Once quarantined, you will be able to view the message or file in question by visiting the #nightfall-content-slack or #nightfall-quarantine-slack channels. Note that the original content will be temporarily replaced with a tombstone message, while it is in a quarantined state.

If you still cannot access the sensitive message or file, please contact [support@nightfall.ai](mailto:support@nightfall.ai) for assistance.

**To view this content on Nightfall Pro for Slack,** you would need to be invited into the private channel or group that contains the sensitive data or consult with a user who has the ability to access those parts of the workspace.\
