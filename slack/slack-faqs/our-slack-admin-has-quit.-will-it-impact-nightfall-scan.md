# Our Slack Admin has Quit. Will it impact Nightfall Scan?

If the Slack admin who originally approved Nightfall leaves the company, Nightfall will lose its scanning access to your Slack account. When this happens, youâ€™ll see an error in the Nightfall Console under **Integrations > Slack > Manage**.&#x20;

You must execute the following steps to resume scanning.\


1. Navigate to the **Slack > Apps > Nightfall Enterprise DLP for Slack > Configuration**. This will open Nightfall in Slack's Marketplace.
2. Click Configuration > Remove App..
3. Go back to the Nightfall console **Integrations > Slack > Manage.**
4. Follow the authorization steps outlined on the [Slack Setup page](https://help.nightfall.ai/slack/getting_started/install)
