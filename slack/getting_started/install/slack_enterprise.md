    Note: If the authorization fails, the Discovery API is not yet enabled in your Slack organization. Contact your Slack sales rep or write to exports@slack.com[^1] to enable this.
4. Once you have granted access to the Discovery API, you will be directed back to the dashboard to install the Nightfall Enterprise bot.&#x20;
5. Click 'Install' to grant our bot access to your Slack workspace.&#x20;
6. Select the ‘Install’ option.
7. Click 'Install'. You will be directed to another 'Allow' page. Select the correct workspace associated with your Nightfall account and click Allow.
8. The workspace you select here will be the one in which Nightfall creates new private channels in which to send you DLP alerts and triage the quarantine. Once complete, Nightfall is installed in your Slack workspace.
