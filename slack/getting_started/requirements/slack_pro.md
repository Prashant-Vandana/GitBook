# Requirements for Nightfall DLP for Slack Pro and Slack Business+

Ensure the following requirements are fulfilled before you get started.

* A service account with permission to install apps in the appropriate workspace is required.
* The Channel Management permission for **“People who can create Private channels”** must be set to **“Everyone, plus Multi-Channel Guests (default)”**. Failure to set this permission will result in a “Restricted Action” error. See [this](https://help.nightfall.ai/nightfall-ai/nightfall-for-slack/nightfall-for-slack-faqs/upon-slack-installation-why-am-i-seeing-a-400-error-mentioning-a-restricted-action) article for instructions on how to check and set this permission. Once you have completed the installation, you can revert the permission to its original setting.
