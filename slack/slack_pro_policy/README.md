# Configuring Policies for Slack Pro and the Slack Business+ Editions

DLP policies are a set of rules that include specific conditions, actions, and exceptions that monitor and filter data. DLP policies help you to monitor and remediate the flow of sensitive data within your organization. Depending on your Nightfall policy configuration, you can set up policies to monitor data that is sent through some or all applications within your organization. You can configure policies and choose to not apply them all the time.&#x20;

Before you define a policy, or a set of policies, you must define the objectives of each policy, which can then be fulfilled when you configure the policy. Here are a few important questions to ask before configuring your policies:&#x20;

• What data do you plan to monitor?&#x20;

• Where within the organization do you want to monitor?&#x20;

• What should be the scope of each policy?&#x20;

• What conditions must apply for the policy to match?&#x20;

• What exceptions/exclusions can be allowed?&#x20;

• What remediation actions should the policy take?&#x20;

You can now set up policies to determine which Slack channels are monitored (and which are excluded) for violations and what actions Nightfall must take. Policies determine the content that will be scanned by Nightfall, and workflows that are followed to manage violations.&#x20;

Policies for Slack integration allow you to define configurations specific to Slack, such as how to handle messages for particular channels or use automated actions such as Quarantine.

Creating a Nightfall policy involves the following tasks:

1. Create Policies
2. Define the policy scope and exclusions
3. Configure Detection Rule
4. Configure Automated Actions

**Note:** Instructions to configure policies differ for Slack Pro and Slack Enterprise options. Refer to the Slack tier that you are using.
