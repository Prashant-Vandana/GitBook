# Configure Automated Actions in Slack Pro and Slack Business+

This section describes the various actions that Nightfall automatically takes when a violation is detected. To enable an action, you must turn on the toggle switch. Additionally, you can set a timeline for when the action should be takenâ€”either immediately after detecting a violation or after a specified delay.

Currently, Nightfall supports the **Delete Message** and **Delete File** automated actions for the Slack Pro and Business+ editions.

To enable any of the automated actions, you must first turn on the toggle switch. Once the toggle switch is enabled, you can configure the timing for the action. If you select **immediately**, the action is executed as soon as sensitive data is detected.&#x20;

If you select **After**, you must also set the time frame when the action must be applied, after detecting the sensitive data.
