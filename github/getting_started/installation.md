# Install Nightfall for GitHub

You can install Nightfall for GitHub via the [Nightfall console](installation.md#installing-nightfall-for-github-from-nightfall-console). The Nightfall app for GitHub requires the following permissions:

* **Read** access to code, commit statuses, and metadata
* **Read** and **write** access to issues and pull requests
  * Nightfall has an option to notify developers for violations via email. Further, the Nightfall app for GitHub also needs read and write permissions on issues and pull requests to tag developers in pull request comments. These permissions are needed by Nightfall to tag developers for violations in a commit or a Pull Request.&#x20;

## Installing Nightfall for GitHub from Nightfall console

To install from Nightfall's console,

1. Go to Nightfall's dashboard [here](https://app.nightfall.ai/dashboard).
2. Click **GitHub** under **My Integrations**. The GitHub Account Information screen displays. If GitHub is not listed under My Integrations but is in Available Integrations, please reach out to your Nightfall contact.&#x20;
3. Click **+ Add Org**. The GitHub sign-in page displays.
4. Log in to the GitHub instance where you wish to install Nightfall for GitHub. If you are already logged in to your GitHub account, you only need to enter the password.

Nightfall recommends you to select this option. To monitor only a specific set of repositories, select Only select repositories radio button and select the required repositories.
6. Click **Install and Authorize**.
