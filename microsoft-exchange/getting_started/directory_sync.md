# Setting up Directory Sync

To monitor Emails, within MS Outlook, Nightfall requires the user information from your corporate directory (commonly an Azure Entra setup). To enable Nightfall to discover user information, you would need to setup the Directory Sync feature. You can refer to the steps mentioned in the [microsoft\_entra\_id.md](../../nightfall_settings/directory_sync/microsoft_entra_id.md "mention") document to setup the Directory Sync.&#x20;

Important

If you are using Nightfall for Microsoft 365 (OneDrive or MS Teams) and have already configured Directory Sync, you need not configure it again for Exchange.&#x20;
