# Configure Detection Rules for Google Drive

In this section, you can select the Detection rules for the policy and If not already created, you can create detection rules. To learn more about how to configure detection rules, see [Configuring Detection Rules](https://docs.nightfall.ai/docs/creating-detection-rules).

To configure detection rules, select the detection rules from the list of rules that are displayed.&#x20;

Once you select Detection rules, you can now view the following three options.&#x20;

* **All Detection Rules**: View all detection rules created
* **Selected Detection Rules**: View detection rules that are selected and mapped to this policy
* **Unselected Detection Rules**: View detection rules that are neither selected nor mapped to this policy.&#x20;
