# Configure Scope for SharePoint

The Scope section allows you to select specific sections of SharePoint to be monitored. Once you select the Sites or group of sites to be monitored, you can further add granular level filters to exclude the monitoring of specific libraries, file extensions, and folder paths within the selected site(s).&#x20;

**Note**: If you have configured multiple Microsoft tenants in Nightfall, you must first select the tenant to be monitored.&#x20;

Nightfall provides the following sections on the Scope page.&#x20;
