* You may also require an authenticator app, like a [Microsoft Authenticator](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/download-and-install-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-351498fc-850a-45da-b7b6-27e523b8702a) app or an [Authy](https://authy.com) app,  in case you have enabled multi-factor authentication for your Microsoft SharePoint.
