# Install Nightfall for Confluence

This document explains the process of installing Nightfall DLP for Confluence.&#x20;

## Prerequisites

The installation of Confluence integration requires you to have the following prerequisites

* An Atlassian tenant with Confluence enabled.&#x20;
* You must have access and must be logged in to the Atlassian account.&#x20;

## Installation Method

JIRA and Confluence are both products of Atlassian. Hence, the installation procedure for **Nightfall for JIRA** and **Nightfall for Confluence** is similar with a few minor changes. You must first log in to your Atlassian account on which you wish to install the Nightfall for Confluence integration. This login must be done on the same browser from which you are accessing the Nightfall application. Nightfall automatically lists all the Atlassian accounts to which you are logged in. You must authorize Nightfall to your Atlassian account on which you wish to install Nightfall for Confluence. Once the authorization is completed, you must install the **DLP for Confluence** application from the [Atlassian marketplace](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1226823/dlp-for-jira-nightfall-ai?hosting=cloud\&tab=overview).&#x20;

## Installation Steps

1. Log in to your Atlassian tenant on which you wish to install the Nightfall for Confluence integration.
2. Log in to the Nightfall application, in a new tab, from the same browser, used to log in to Atlassian.&#x20;
3. Click **Integrations** under the **Configuration** section.
4. Click **Manage** for the **Confluence** integration.
