# Integrating with Security Tools

Many customers choose to leverage other security tools, such as SIEMs (e.g. Splunk, Sumo Logic, etc.), to aggregate security-related information and SOARs (e.g. Cortex, Phantom, etc.) to orchestrate remediation & response. With Nightfall, you can export historical scan results and automatically push real-time alerts to third-party sources like a SIEM. From there, you can leverage SIEM capabilities to aggregate, search, filter, and manage alerts.

Some customers have also used workflow tools (e.g. Zapier) to automate workflows or to manipulate data.&#x20;
