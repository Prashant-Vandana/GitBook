## Testing Nightfall Browser DLP in ChatGPT

Try one of the demo prompts below

* **B2C Billing Use Case**
  * Compose a polite email to a customer whose credit card number was declined. The customer's name is Tony Smith, and his Visa card number is 4716-3495-2472-4539. Please also verify if his card number is correct.
* **HR Use Case**
  * Write a paragraph that I can use to verify the social security number for our new employee, Lisa Smith. I have 323-10-3335 as her SSN.

When your prompt contains sensitive data, Nightfall blocks the prompt and shows the following warning message.
