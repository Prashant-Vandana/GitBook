# Configure Advanced Settings for AI Apps

This stage allows you to select notification channels if a policy violation occurs. The notification alerts are sent at two levels.

This section allows you to send notifications to Nightfall users. The various alert methods are as follows. You must first turn on the toggle switch to use an alert method.

{% hint style="info" %}
The alert configurations configured in this section describe the process of creating alerts at the policy level. Policy-level alerts apply only to the policy on which they are configured. To configure an alert on all the Gmail policies, you must configure alerts at the integration level. To learn more about how to configure integration-level policies for the Gmail integration, read [this document](https://help.nightfall.ai/nightfall-ai/nightfall-for-chatgpt/configuring-integration-alerts).
{% endhint %}

The steps to configure alert channels for policy-level integration are the same as in the case of integration-level alerts. You can refer to [this document](https://help.nightfall.ai/nightfall-ai/nightfall-for-chatgpt/configuring-integration-alerts#configure-alerts-at-the-integration-level) for steps.
